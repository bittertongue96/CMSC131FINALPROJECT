Assembly Game


Project Summary 

The game’s concept is similar to that of many 90’s arcade games where repetition and fast reaction is the key to reaching the highest possible score. As the player’s score increases per block left behind, the player also decreases his chances of winning by leaving himself a smaller area to work with each time.  				

Similar to the Snake series, the game rules don’t allow the player to walk over his/her own blocks. The player can if he/she wishes to exit the game quickly and start over, if not uninstall the game entirely due to anger management issues, but that is not recommended. 

To add to the game’s excitement, the developers included a ‘free roaming object’. Its path and behavior designed to make the game both more challenging and fun. Its diagonal movements were intended to make it less predictable, to add to the fact that this enemy can easily bounce off certain blocks at certain direction. Meeting the free roaming object head on is not recommended as it will also cause the player to exit the game, and perhaps to some extent uninstall as well. 

In addition to the game’s next generation features, one can also pause the game by having the player touch any of the borders. This causes the whole game, enemy and all, as the player contemplates on his next move. The developers consider this border as a ‘safe spot’ where the  player can pass, but the enemy can’t. The developers recommend that players will have to think carefully before blocking off and pass along that area as a last resort. 

The game uses the DOSBOX’s masm as its platform and was made from scratch by emulating the 80386 processor to compile and run the game.
