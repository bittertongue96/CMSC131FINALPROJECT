 The game’s concept is similar to that of many 90’s arcade games where repetition and
fast reaction is the key to reaching the highest possible score. As the player’s score increases
per block left behind, the player also decreases his chances of winning by leaving himself a
smaller area to work with each time.
Similar to the Snake series, the game rules don’t allow the player to walk over his/her
own blocks. The player can if he/she wishes to exit the game quickly and start over, if not
uninstall the game entirely due to anger management issues, but that is not recommended.
To add to the game’s excitement, the developers included a ‘free roaming object’. Its
path and behavior designed to make the game both more challenging and fun. The roaming
object can only move diagonally. At an angle, it has the ability to bounce off a block, loop
around the block, or ignore it completely. This adds to the unpredictability of the roaming
object’s movements as the player makes his/her rounds across the map.
However, not all things were created to amuse the developers alone. So to make the
game fair, the developers also made the roaming object able to consume each block it bounces
off of. Giving the player more room to work with and even a pixel sized escape route if done
right. All that said, meeting the free roaming object head on is not recommended as it will also
cause the player to exit the game, and perhaps to some extent uninstall as well.
In addition to the game’s next generation features, one can also pause the game by
having the player touch any of the borders. This causes the whole game, enemy and all, to
freeze as the player contemplates on his next move(enemy disappears during the pause and
reapppears once player is ready again). The developers consider this border as a ‘safe spot’
where the player can pass, but the enemy can’t. The developers recommend that players will
have to think carefully before blocking it off, and only pass along that area as a last resort.
The game uses the DOSBOX’s masm as its platform and was made from scratch by
emulating the 80386 processor to compile and run the game.
